# Given arrival and departure times of all trains that reach a railway station,
#find the minimum number of platforms required for the railway station so that
#no train waits. We are given two arrays which represent arrival and departure times
#of trains that stop

# Input:  arr[]  = [9:00,  9:40, 9:50,  11:00, 15:00, 18:00]
#         dep[]  = [9:10, 12:00, 11:20, 11:30, 19:00, 20:00]
# Output: 3
# There are at-most three trains at a time (time between 11:00 to 11:20)
